# Introduction
Buffalo's temperature in October is very changeable. Take this year's October for example, we had a cool weekend with temperature around 70°F then following a 90°F hot weekday. Also, my travel experience shows that downtown area is usually cooler than UB north campus. However, the weather broadcast only reports one single temperature value for the whole city, which is not accurate enough. Such condition may cause health problems such as getting cold due to a sudden temperature drop. Imprecise broadcast may also make farmers ignore protection activities and will cause negative effect on the agriculture productivity. Based on an interview with an expert from weather institution, three factors can have main effect on the temperature change: wind speed, wind direction and sunshine. 

This study will focus on how the temperature spreads across the city over a 31-day period in October based on ordinary kriging method and discovering the linear relationship between temperature and three factors by using regression method. 


# Data for the study
The data used for this study will be acquired from NOAA's climate data online, the original data was recorded in csv file. The original data has many fields that the research doesn't need and some stations miss necessary data. I have used excel to do some pretreatment on the dataset.

* check the package needed for the study

```{r}
library(rmarkdown)
library(knitr)
library(RCurl)
```

* First check the format of data

```{r}
read.csv('data.csv', nrow=5)
```

# Method for the study
(I learned the kriging method from another course by 11/8, still working on how to use R to conduct kriging interpolation, so these four parts are still under construction and could be finished before 11/20)

# Results
Show tables, plots, etc. and describe them.

# Conclusions
What have you learned?  Are there any broader implications?

We are going to use the `occ()` function to download _occurrence_ records for the American robin (_Turdus migratorius_) from the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](gbif.org).
