# Introduction
Buffalo's temperature in October is very changeable. Take this year's October for example, we had a cool weekend with temperature around 70°F then following a 90°F hot weekday. Also, my travel experience shows that downtown area is usually cooler than UB north campus. However, the weather broadcast only reports one single temperature value for the whole city, which is not accurate enough. Such condition may cause health problems such as getting cold due to a sudden temperature drop. Imprecise broadcast may also make farmers ignore protection activities and will cause negative effect on the agriculture productivity. Based on a interview with an expert from weather institution, three factors can have main effect on the temperature change: wind speed, wind direction and sunshine. This study will focus on how the temperature spreads across the city based on ordinary kriging method and the linear relationship between temperature and three factors. 


# Data for the study
In this study we will use data acquired from NOAA, we will use API to get access to the data we want, first we need to check the necessary pacakge:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
```
####################
Narrative and most code will go here.  Describe what you are doing and show how to do it (with code).

You can do bullets like this:

* The first most important thing
* The second most important thing
* The third most important thing

You can do numbers like this:

1. The first most important thing
2. The second most important thing
3. The third most important thing

See [http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for all the amazing things you can do.


Here's my first code chunk.
```{r}
1+2
```

Load any required packages in a code chunk (you may need to install some packages):

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(maps)
library(spocc)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)  # cache the results for quick compiling
```


We are going to use the `occ()` function to download _occurrence_ records for the American robin (_Turdus migratorius_) from the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](gbif.org).
